# Programming Methods:

# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):

Classes: Utilizes classes such as customer, employee, and room to encapsulate related data and functions, promoting code organization and reusability.

Encapsulation: Achieves encapsulation by bundling the data (attributes) and methods (functions) into classes, preventing direct access to internal details and enhancing code modularity.

Inheritance: Establishes an inheritance hierarchy, with customer and employee inheriting common functionalities from a general class. This reduces code duplication and enhances maintainability.

Polymorphism: Employs polymorphism through functions like setRoomDetails() and setCustomerDetails(), allowing flexibility in handling different types of data.

# Vector Containers:
Dynamic Memory Allocation: Utilizes dynamic memory allocation with vectors to manage rooms, customers, and facilitate dynamic resizing as needed.

# User-Driven Interaction:
Console Input/Output: Integrates console-based user interaction for simplicity. Users are prompted with menu options and guided through each operation.

# Modular Design:
Functions: Implements modular design with functions like manageRooms(), checkin(), checkout(), cancelReservation(), and searchCustomer(), promoting code organization and readability.

# Error Handling:
Input Validation: Ensures data integrity through input validation mechanisms, prompting users to re-enter data in case of invalid inputs.

# Continuous Interaction:
Menu-Driven Interface: Utilizes a menu-driven interface, allowing users to navigate through various functionalities seamlessly.
